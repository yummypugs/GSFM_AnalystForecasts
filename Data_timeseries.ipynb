    "1. **TR.EPSActValue** - The company's actual value normalized to reflect the I/B/E/S default currency and corporate actions (e.g. stock splits). Earnings Per Share is defined as the EPS that the contributing analyst considers to be that with which to value a security. This figure may include or exclude certain items depending on the contributing analyst's specific model.\n",

Enterprise Value represents Market Capitalization TR.F.MktCap + Debt including Preferred Equity & Minority Interest - Total [TR.F.DebtlnclPrefEqMinlntrTot] (-) Cash & Short Term Investments - Total [TR.F.CashSTlnvstTot]. Market Capitalization [TR.F.MktCap] is required. The data item is calculated for all periodicities. It is applicable to all industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TR.LTGMean** - Long Term Growth - Mean:  The statistical average of all broker estimates determined to be on the majority accounting basis. Long-term growth is an estimate of the compound average rate of EPS growth an analyst expects over a period of three to five ears.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. change in recommendation\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **TR.PriceTargetMean** The statistical average of all broker estimates determined to be on the majority accounting basis. Price target is the projected price level forecasted by the analyst within a specific time horizon.\n",
