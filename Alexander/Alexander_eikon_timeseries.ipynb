    "1. **TR.EPSActValue** - The company's actual value normalized to reflect the I/B/E/S default currency and corporate actions (e.g. stock splits). Earnings Per Share is defined as the EPS that the contributing analyst considers to be that with which to value a security. This figure may include or exclude certain items depending on the contributing analyst's specific model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TR.EPSMean** - The statistical average of all broker estimates determined to be on the majority accounting basis. Earnings Per Share is defined as the EPS that the contributing analyst considers to be that with which to value a security. This figure may include or exclude certain items depending on the contributing analyst's specific model.\n",

    "3. **TR.EPSActSurprise** - The difference between the actual and the last mean of the period, expressed as a percentage. Earnings Per Share is defined as the EPS that the contributing analyst considers to be that with which to value a security.

    "\n",
    "### Firm charateristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TR.RevenueActValue** - The company's actual value normalized to reflect the I/B/E/S default currency and corporate actions (e.g. stock splits). Revenue (or Sales) is a corporation's net revenue, generally derived from core business activities. For non-financial companies, the calculation of net revenue (or net turnover) in most markets generally involves subtracting transportation and related operational costs from gross revenue/sales.

    "\n",
    "2. **TR.F.EV** - Enterprise Value is the Company's total economic value OR the theoretical takeover price, often used as an alternative to market capitalization. Enterprise Value represents Market Capitalization TR.F.MktCap + Debt including Preferred Equity & Minority Interest - Total [TR.F.DebtlnclPrefEqMinlntrTot] (-) Cash & Short Term Investments - Total [TR.F.CashSTlnvstTot]. Market Capitalization [TR.F.MktCap] is required. The data item is calculated for all periodicities. It is applicable to all industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **TR.LTGMean** - Long Term Growth - Mean:  The statistical average of all broker estimates determined to be on the majority accounting basis. Long-term growth is an estimate of the compound average rate of EPS growth an analyst expects over a period of three to five ears.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysts\n",
    "1. **TR.NumberOfAnalysts** - Number of sell-side analysts covering the security.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TR.RecMean** - Recommendation Numeric Mean based on the Standard Scale Of Strong Buy (1 ), Buy (2), Hold (3), Sell (4), and Strong Sell (5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Macro characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TR.WACCInflationAdjRiskFreeRate** -  Inflation adjusted risk free rate used is Of the primary index for the domicile country Of the company. Inflation adjusted risk free rate (Rf) is calculated from the US 10-year treasury yield plus the difference between in the 10-year forecasted inflation rate between the given country and the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Firm Status (0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TR.F.NetIncAfterTax** Net Income after Tax [SIAT] represents the income/expense after all operating and non-operating income and expense, reserves, income taxes, but before equity in earnings, minority interest, extraordinary items, after-tax adjustments, discontinued operations and preferred dividends. Applicable to all Industries. Net Income after Tax [SIAT] includes: • Net Income after Tax [XIAT]\n",

    "#### ESG\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TR.TRESGScore** Refinitiv ESG Score is an overall company score based on the self-reported information in the environmental, social and corporate governance pillars.\n",
